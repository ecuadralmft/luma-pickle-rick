# 🥒 Pickle Rick v2 — Multi-Agent Orchestrator

A persona-driven multi-agent orchestrator for [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev) with a full engineering lifecycle engine. Pickle Rick reads any spec, decomposes it into tickets, classifies complexity, runs adaptive per-ticket lifecycles (research → plan → implement → verify → refactor), enforces anti-slop rules, isolates work in git worktrees, and doesn't stop until the spec is fully implemented and verified.

                                                                    ᵇʸ ᵉᵈᵍᵃʳᵈ

## v2 Features

### Adaptive Per-Ticket Lifecycle

Rick classifies each ticket at decomposition time:

**SIMPLE** (scaffolding, config, docs, one-liners):
```
Assign → Execute → Verify → Done
```

**COMPLEX** (new features, refactors, integrations, business logic):
```
Research → Plan → Implement → Verify → Refactor → Done
```

Classification heuristic:
- SIMPLE: scaffolding/docs/utility phase, short description, no cross-ticket dependencies
- COMPLEX: implementation phase, new business logic, API changes, data model changes, requires tests

### Triggered PRD Phase

Rick evaluates spec clarity before decomposing. If the spec is vague (< 5 sentences, contains "improve"/"fix"/"make better" without specifics, lacks acceptance criteria, or references multiple unrelated features), Rick interrogates you with targeted questions and drafts a PRD to `conductor/prd.md`.

Skipped when the spec is detailed, already contains acceptance criteria, or you say "skip PRD".

### Dual Session State

Two files, always in sync:

- `conductor/tracks.md` — human-readable ticket registry with complexity tags (`[SIMPLE]`/`[COMPLEX]`), lifecycle phase indicators, and retry counts
- `conductor/state.json` — machine-readable session state with full ticket metadata, artifact paths, compliance scores, and worktree branches

Both updated after every status change. `tracks.md` is rendered from `state.json`.

### Anti-Slop Enforcement

Three layers:

1. **Morty (codified rules)** — no obvious comments, no `any`/`unknown` types, no defensive bloat, no "just in case" parameters, merge functions that should be one, prefer composition over inheritance
2. **Summer (slop scoring)** — flags AI-generated boilerplate, redundant comments, unnecessary abstractions, dead code. Reports a Slop Score (0–5) in every test report
3. **Rick (diff audit)** — reads `git diff` after implementation, dispatches targeted meeseeks tasks for each cleanup item found

### Rick-Directed Refactor

After morty implements and summer verifies (PASS):

1. Rick reads `git diff` for the ticket
2. Identifies slop: redundant comments, mergeable functions, `any` types, dead code, naming issues
3. Dispatches atomic meeseeks tasks — one change, one file, done
4. Summer re-verifies after cleanup to catch regressions
5. If cleanup breaks tests, cleanup is reverted (implementation preserved)

Skipped when: slop score is 0, ticket is SIMPLE, or diff is < 20 lines.

### Git Worktree Isolation

Each COMPLEX ticket runs in its own git worktree:

```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/TICKET-001 -b pickle/TICKET-001
```

- SIMPLE tickets run in the main tree
- On success: merge back with `--no-ff`, remove worktree and branch
- On blocked: remove worktree without merging
- Falls back to main-tree execution if git is not initialized

Subagents receive `WORKTREE_PATH` in their context for COMPLEX tickets.

### Pickle Jar

Task queue for saving specs and batch-executing later.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| "jar this" / "save for later" | Saves current spec to `conductor/jar/task-NNN.json` with status `queued` |
| "open the jar" / "night shift" | Executes all queued tasks sequentially, each with its own full orchestration cycle |
| "jar status" | Lists all tasks with their status |

Tasks are priority-sorted (1 = highest), with FIFO tiebreaker for equal priorities.

### Per-Ticket Artifacts

COMPLEX tickets produce structured artifacts:

- `conductor/tickets/[id]/research.md` — what exists, file:line references, data flows, constraints
- `conductor/tickets/[id]/plan.md` — specific files to modify, step-by-step changes, verification commands
- `conductor/tickets/[id]/test-results.md` — verdict, slop score, test results, edge cases

SIMPLE tickets produce no artifacts.

### God Complex Protocol

Morty doesn't hack workarounds — he invents solutions:
- Missing utility? Create it as a proper module, not an inline hack
- Trivial dependency? Write it yourself
- Every invented utility must live in a sensible location, be exported, documented, and reusable

Rick audits: inlined hacks get extracted to modules, trivial dependencies get flagged.

### Completion Promise

Rick doesn't stop until:
- Every ticket is resolved (done or blocked)
- Final compliance check passes against the original spec
- Any compliance gaps have been addressed or acknowledged

If the compliance check finds gaps, Rick creates fix tickets and runs another round.

---

## Permission Modes

Set by Rick at session start. Cascades to all subagents.

| Mode | Behavior | File Deletion |
|------|----------|---------------|
| 🟢 FULL_AUTONOMY | Runs everything, reports at the end. Fix tickets created automatically. | Auto-approved silently |
| 🟡 SUPERVISED | Runs in batches per phase, shows progress, asks to continue. | Allowed with warning |
| 🔴 MANUAL | Shows each ticket before delegating, waits for approval. | Blocked until explicitly approved |

### Switching Autonomy Mid-Session

You can change the autonomy level at any time during execution:

```
> Switch to manual
> Change autonomy to supervised
> Go full auto
```

Rick updates `conductor/state.json`, announces the change, and all subsequent agent actions (including the file deletion guard) follow the new mode immediately.

### File Deletion Guard

A `preToolUse` hook (`guard-delete.sh`) intercepts any bash command containing `rm`, `rmdir`, `unlink`, or `shred` and enforces the current autonomy mode's deletion policy. This runs on every agent (morty, summer, meeseeks, and Rick himself).

---

## The Conductor System

The `conductor/` directory is Pickle Rick's brain on disk — the persistent state engine that powers the entire orchestration lifecycle. It's created automatically in your project's working directory when Rick starts a session.

### What the Conductor Does

| Capability | File | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| **Project Detection** | `conductor/project-context.md` | Auto-scans workspace on first run — detects language, framework, dependencies, test runner, CI/CD config. Included in every subagent's context so workers understand the codebase. |
| **PRD Drafting** | `conductor/prd.md` | When Rick detects a vague spec, he interrogates the user and produces a structured PRD (problem statement, objectives, scope, CUJs, functional requirements, risks). Skipped for clear specs. |
| **Ticket Registry** | `conductor/tracks.md` | Human-readable ticket board with status markers (`[ ]` pending, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` done, `[!]` blocked), complexity tags, retry counts, and phase groupings. |
| **Session State** | `conductor/state.json` | Machine-readable state — session ID, timestamps, permission mode, per-ticket metadata (status, lifecycle phase, worktree branch, artifact paths), phase completion tracking, and compliance scores. |
| **Per-Ticket Research** | `conductor/tickets/[id]/research.md` | Morty's codebase analysis for COMPLEX tickets — documents what exists with file:line references, data flows, constraints, and open questions. Strictly observational (what IS, not what SHOULD BE). |
| **Per-Ticket Plans** | `conductor/tickets/[id]/plan.md` | Implementation plan with specific files to modify, step-by-step changes with checkboxes, scope boundaries (in/out), and verification commands. Rick reviews for specificity before approving. |
| **Test Results** | `conductor/tickets/[id]/test-results.md` | Summer's verdict — PASS/FAIL, individual test results, edge cases tested, Slop Score (0–5), and slop findings with file:line references for Rick's refactor audit. |
| **Task Queue** | `conductor/jar/task-NNN.json` | Pickle Jar — saved specs with priority, status (queued/running/done/failed), and timestamps. Batch-executed sequentially on "open the jar". |
| **Spec Compliance** | `conductor/state.json` (compliance field) | After all tickets resolve, Rick re-reads the original spec and checks every requirement for traceability, completion, and correctness. Gaps trigger fix tickets. |

```

### Session Resume

The conductor persists across sessions. If you quit mid-execution and come back, Rick's `agentSpawn` hook detects `conductor/state.json`, displays the current ticket board, and offers to resume where you left off. No work is lost.

### Artifact Retention

After completion, Rick asks: "Want me to keep the audit trail (`conductor/tickets/`) or clean it up?" The research, plans, and test results serve as a full audit trail of every decision made during the session.

## Usage

### Quick Start

Pickle Rick uses your **current working directory** as the project scope — that's where `conductor/` state, `validate-write.sh` boundaries, and `.worktrees/` all live. Always `cd` into your target project folder before launching.

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
cd ~/my-project
git init                    # enables worktree isolation for COMPLEX tickets
kiro-cli chat --agent pickle-rick
```

One-liner:
```bash
(cd ~/my-project && git init && kiro-cli chat --agent pickle-rick)
```

Full autonomy (no tool confirmations):
```bash
cd ~/my-project && git init
kiro-cli chat --agent pickle-rick --trust-all-tools
```

Quick test with inline prompt:
```bash
mkdir ~/test-project && cd ~/test-project && git init
kiro-cli chat --agent pickle-rick "Build a Python CLI that converts CSV to JSON."
```

#### Windows (WSL / Ubuntu on Windows) — Recommended

Pickle Rick on Windows runs through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Open your WSL terminal (search "Ubuntu" in Start menu, or run `wsl` from PowerShell).

**Using a WSL-native project folder (best performance):**
```bash
cd ~/my-project
git init
kiro-cli chat --agent pickle-rick
```

**Accessing a Windows folder from WSL (works with OneDrive, Desktop, etc.):**
```bash
# Windows paths are available under /mnt/c/ — always quote paths with spaces
cd "/mnt/c/Users/YourName/OneDrive - Company/Projects/my-project"
git init
kiro-cli chat --agent pickle-rick --trust-all-tools
```

Full autonomy from a Windows folder:
```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents/my-project"
git init
kiro-cli chat --agent pickle-rick --trust-all-tools
```

> **⚠️ Windows paths in WSL:**
> - Windows drives are mounted at `/mnt/c/`, `/mnt/d/`, etc.
> - **Always quote paths with spaces:** `cd "/mnt/c/Users/You/OneDrive - Company/folder"`
> - Performance is slower on `/mnt/c/` than WSL-native `~/` paths — for large projects, consider cloning into `~/`
> - OneDrive folders work fine — just use the full `/mnt/c/` path with quotes

#### Windows (PowerShell — native, no WSL)

If kiro-cli is installed natively on Windows without WSL:

```powershell
# IMPORTANT: Always quote paths that contain spaces
mkdir "$HOME\my-project"
cd "$HOME\my-project"
git init
kiro-cli chat --agent pickle-rick
```

Full autonomy:
```powershell
cd "$HOME\my-project"
git init
kiro-cli chat --agent pickle-rick --trust-all-tools
```

> **⚠️ PowerShell gotchas:**
> - **Paths with spaces MUST be quoted:** `cd "C:\Users\You\OneDrive - Company\project"` — without quotes, PowerShell treats spaces as argument separators and you'll get `ParameterBindingException`
> - **Don't chain `cd` with `;`:** If `cd` fails, the next command still runs in the wrong directory. Use separate lines.
> - **`mkdir` first:** Unlike bash, `cd` to a non-existent folder gives `PathNotFound`. Create it first.
> - **Hooks require bash:** Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (includes Git Bash) or use WSL.

#### Swap to Pickle Rick inside an existing chat

```
/agent swap pickle-rick
```
Or use the keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+P`

The `--trust-all-tools` flag skips ALL tool confirmation prompts at the CLI level. Combined with choosing 🟢 FULL_AUTONOMY inside the session, this is fully hands-off execution.

### Giving Rick a spec

Once in a session, give Rick something to work with:
```
> Read SPEC.md and execute it
> Here's what I need built: [paste spec inline]
```

Rick will: evaluate spec clarity → (optionally) run PRD phase → decompose into tickets → classify complexity → execute lifecycle → verify compliance → done.

### Pickle Jar commands

```
> Jar this                    # Save current spec for later
> Add to jar                  # Same
> Open the jar                # Execute all queued tasks
> Night shift                 # Same
> Jar status                  # List queued/running/done tasks
```

### Reconnecting

If you quit mid-session, Rick detects `conductor/tracks.md` and `conductor/state.json` on next start and offers to resume where you left off.

### Invoking agents directly

```
/agent swap morty       # Implementation
/agent swap summer      # QA
/agent swap beth        # Documentation
/agent swap jerry       # Scaffolding
/agent swap meeseeks    # Utility tasks
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Required | Used by | How to install |
|------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Kiro CLI** | ✅ Yes | Core runtime — the CLI that runs the agents | [kiro.dev](https://kiro.dev) — follow the install guide for your platform |
| **Git** | ✅ Yes | Worktree isolation, `git diff` auditing, `git revert` safety, branch-per-ticket | macOS: `brew install git` or `xcode-select --install`<br>Linux: `sudo apt install git` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo yum install git` (RHEL/Fedora)<br>Windows: [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) — includes Git Bash |
| **Python 3** | ✅ Yes | All hooks use `python3` to parse JSON events from Kiro CLI; `install.sh` uses it to merge settings | macOS: `brew install python3` (or pre-installed)<br>Linux: `sudo apt install python3` (usually pre-installed)<br>Windows: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) — check "Add to PATH" during install |
| **Bash** | ✅ Yes | All hooks (`.sh` files), `install.sh` | macOS/Linux: pre-installed<br>Windows: included with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), or use WSL |

> **Without Git:** Rick falls back to single-directory mode with a warning — worktree isolation and diff-based refactoring are disabled. Everything else still works.
>
> **Without Python 3:** Hooks will fail silently — the deletion guard, write validator, audit logger, and turn checker all depend on `python3` for JSON parsing. Run `python3 --version` to verify it's in your PATH.
>
> **Without Bash (Windows only):** Hooks won't execute. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (includes Git Bash) or use WSL.

### Verify prerequisites

```bash
# Run these to confirm everything is installed
kiro-cli --version        # Kiro CLI
git --version             # Git
python3 --version         # Python 3
bash --version            # Bash (relevant on Windows)
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ecuadralmft/luma-pickle-rick.git
cd luma-pickle-rick
./install.sh
```

### Windows (WSL / Ubuntu on Windows) — Recommended

```bash
# Run inside your WSL terminal
git clone https://github.com/ecuadralmft/luma-pickle-rick.git
cd luma-pickle-rick
./install.sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell — native, no WSL)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ecuadralmft/luma-pickle-rick.git
cd luma-pickle-rick
bash install.sh    # requires Git Bash or bash in PATH
```

> **Note:** The hooks are bash scripts. On native Windows without WSL, install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (includes Git Bash) to get bash in your PATH. WSL is the recommended approach for Windows users.

The installer copies agents, prompts, and hooks to `~/.kiro/` and enables the required settings.

---

## Configuration

Agent configs live in `~/.kiro/agents/` (JSON). Persona prompts live in `~/.kiro/prompts/` (TXT).

Required settings (enabled by `install.sh`):
```bash
kiro-cli settings chat.enableSubagent true
kiro-cli settings chat.enableDelegate true
```
